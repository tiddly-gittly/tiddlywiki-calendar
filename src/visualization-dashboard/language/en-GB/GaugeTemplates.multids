GaugeTemplate/CountUpDays/Caption: Counts up days.
GaugeTemplate/CountUpDays/Description: Shows the number of days from the end of an tiddler (`endDate`) to now.
GaugeTemplate/CountDownNearestTagHours/Caption: Nearest tag countdown hours
GaugeTemplate/CountDownNearestTagHours/Description: Shows the number of hours left to the `startDate` of the nearest "tiddler with this tag" for a given tag. (e.g. how many hours left until the start of tonight's tiddler tagged "sleep")
GaugeTemplate/CountTagHoursWeek/Caption: Tag hours for the week
GaugeTemplate/CountTagHoursWeek/Description: Counts the total duration (`endDate - startDate` end minus beginning) of this week's "tiddlers with this tag" for a particular tag till now. (e.g. how many hours did the tiddler tagged "sleep" sleep this week)
GaugeTemplate/CountTagHoursYear/Caption: Tag hours for the year
GaugeTemplate/CountTagHoursYear/Description: Counts the number of hours of total duration of "tiddlers with this tag" for a given tag over 365 days. (Unlike other weekly and daily level statistics that count tiddlers, this meter does not count tiddlers by default.)
GaugeTemplate/CountTagDaysAppearWeek/Caption: tagged days of the week
GaugeTemplate/CountTagDaysAppearWeek/Description: Counts the number of days this week that a tag has "tiddlers with this tag". (e.g., how many days this week there were tiddlers tagged with "fitness"?)

GaugeTemplate/LineTagHoursWeek/Caption: Hours per day for this week's tags.
GaugeTemplate/LineTagHoursWeek/Description: A bar chart showing the duration (`endDate - startDate` end minus beginning) of each day of the week for a tag till now. (e.g. how many hours a day did the tiddler tagged "sleep" sleep this week)
GaugeTemplate/BarTagDaysWeek/Caption: number of tags per day this week.
GaugeTemplate/BarTagDaysWeek/Description: A bar chart showing the number of days a tag has been tagged each day of the week. (e.g. how many times per day this week were the tiddlers tagged "watch short videos")
GaugeTemplate/PolarTagsHoursWeek/Caption: Hours per day for each tag this week
GaugeTemplate/PolarTagsHoursWeek/Description: A circular bar chart showing the duration of 'entries with this tag' for each day of the week for each of the selected tags, comparing the hours of each activity for the week on a polar coordinate system.
