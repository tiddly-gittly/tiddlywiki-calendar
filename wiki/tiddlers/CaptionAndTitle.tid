title: CaptionAndTitle
tags: EventDisplay
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Events can automatically have a prefix when created, and will forced to have a date time suffix. So created tiddler will have a long title. So we only display tiddler's caption in the calendar. When caption is missing, we will omit the title part of the event.

When creating event, the "title input" is actually for inputting the caption, and the real concatenated title will be shown below that input as a smaller text.
